This folder contains the SIMION workbench used for tuning the vertical SPECTRAP beamline including
the lua program used for reading the beam and printing the beam properties whilst tuning.

I would suggest implementing some sort of optimisation algorithm to simplify tuning, perhaps
using the secant or bisection method for one parameter at the time could reduce the amount of manual
labour somewhat.

In the future the magnetic field from the superconducting magnet also needs to be modeled, all I can
say is god speed to your computer if this is your task. I hope you have a sleeping bag in the office.
