The files contained here are the cosy scripts used for fitting and generating figures and results 
based upon the results of the fitting.

They are written for COSY INFINITY 8.1 by Oliver Kraft during May 2023

The filenaming convention is as follows:

beam_N = "Fitting script used for beam N"
beam_Nv = "Script used for viewing fitting result for beam N"

Unfortunately time did not permit me to figure out text output from COSY, and on windows 10/11 it
seems that copying text does not work from the COSY terminal. If you encounter this issue as well
I would suggest using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool, plenty are availible for free.
They seem to work quite well for getting the voltages/beam matrix from COSY.
